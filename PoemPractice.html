I opened a book and in I strode. </br>
Now nobody can find me. </br>
I've left my chair, my house, </br>
my road, my town and my world </br>
behind me.
<p> I'm wearing the cloak, I've slipped </br>
on the ring, I've swallowed </br>
a magic potion. </br>
I've fought with a dragon, </br>
dined with a king, </br>
and dived in a bottomless ocean.
<p> I opened a book and </br>
made some friends. </br>
I shared their tears and laughter. </br>
And followed their road </br>
with its bumps and bends, </br>
To the happily ever after. 
<p> I finished my book and out I came. </br>
The cloak can no longer hide me. </br>
My chair and my house </br>
are just the same, </br>
But I have a book inside me.
