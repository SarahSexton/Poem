I opened a book and in I strode. </br>
Now nobody can find me. </br>
I've left my chair, my house, </br>
my road, my town and my world </br>
behind me.
<p> I'm wearing the cloak, I've slipped </br>
on the ring, I've swallowed </br>
a magic potion. </br>
I've fought with a dragon, </br>
dined with a king, </br>
and dived in a bottomless ocean.
